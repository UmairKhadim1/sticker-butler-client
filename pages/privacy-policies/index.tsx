            collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that
            Personal Information. It also describes the choices available to you
            regarding our use of your Personal Information and how you can
            access and update it.

          <p>
            This Policy is a legally binding agreement between you (“User”,
            “you” or “your”) and Sundae Labs LLC (“Sundae Labs LLC”, “we”, “us”
            or “our”). If you are entering into this agreement on behalf of a
            business or other legal entity, you represent that you have the
            authority to bind such entity to this agreement, in which case the
            terms “User”, “you” or “your” shall refer to such entity. If you do
            not have such authority, or if you do not agree with the terms of
            this agreement, you must not accept this agreement and may not
            access and use the Services. By accessing and using the Services,
            you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be
            bound by the terms of this Policy. This Policy does not apply to the
            practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to
            individuals that we do not employ or manage.
          </p>
          <h2>Collection of personal information</h2>
          <p>
            You can access and use the Services without telling us who you are
            or revealing any information by which someone could identify you as
            a specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to use
            some of the features offered on the Services, you may be asked to
            provide certain Personal Information (for example, your name and
            e-mail address).
          </p>
          <p>
            We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us
            when you create an account, make a purchase, or fill any forms on
            the Services. When required, this information may include the
            following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Account details (such as user name, unique user ID, password, etc)
            </li>
            <li>
              Contact information (such as email address, phone number, etc)
            </li>
            <li>
              Basic personal information (such as name, country of residence,
              etc)
            </li>
            <li>
              Payment information (such as credit card details, bank details,
              etc)
            </li>
            <li>
              Any other materials you willingly submit to us (such as articles,
              images, feedback, etc)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Some of the information we collect is directly from you via the
            Services. However, we may also collect Personal Information about
            you from other sources such as public databases, social media
            platforms, third-party data providers, and our joint marketing
            partners. Personal Information we collect from other sources may
            include demographic information, such as age and gender, device
            information, such as IP addresses, location, such as city and state,
            and online behavioral data, such as information about your use of
            social media websites, page view information and search results and
            links.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can choose not to provide us with your Personal Information, but
            then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the features
            on the Services. Users who are uncertain about what information is
            mandatory are welcome to contact us.
          </p>
          <h2>Privacy of children</h2>
          <p>
            We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children
            under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, please do not
            submit any Personal Information through the Services. If you have
            reason to believe that a child under the age of 18 has provided
            Personal Information to us through the Services, please contact us
            to request that we delete that child’s Personal Information from our
            Services.
          </p>
          <p>
            We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s
            Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their
            children never to provide Personal Information through the Services
            without their permission. We also ask that all parents and legal
            guardians overseeing the care of children take the necessary
            precautions to ensure that their children are instructed to never
            give out Personal Information when online without their permission.
          </p>
          <h2>Use and processing of collected information</h2>
          <p>
            We act as a data controller and a data processor when handling
            Personal Information, unless we have entered into a data processing
            agreement with you in which case you would be the data controller
            and we would be the data processor.
          </p>
          <p>
            {' '}
            Our role may also differ depending on the specific situation
            involving Personal Information. We act in the capacity of a data
            controller when we ask you to submit your Personal Information that
            is necessary to ensure your access and use of the Services. In such
            instances, we are a data controller because we determine the
            purposes and means of the processing of Personal Information.
          </p>
          <p>
            We act in the capacity of a data processor in situations when you
            submit Personal Information through the Services. We do not own,
            control, or make decisions about the submitted Personal Information,
            and such Personal Information is processed only in accordance with
            your instructions. In such instances, the User providing Personal
            Information acts as a data controller.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to make the Services available to you, or to meet a legal
            obligation, we may need to collect and use certain Personal
            Information. If you do not provide the information that we request,
            we may not be able to provide you with the requested products or
            services. Any of the information we collect from you may be used for
            the following purposes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Create and manage user accounts</li>
            <li>Fulfill and manage orders</li>
            <li>Deliver products or services</li>
            <li>Respond to inquiries and offer support</li>
            <li>Request user feedback</li>
            <li>Improve user experience</li>
            <li>Post customer testimonials</li>
            <li>Enforce terms and conditions and policies</li>
            <li>Protect from abuse and malicious users</li>
            <li>Respond to legal requests and prevent harm</li>
            <li>Run and operate the Services</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact
            with the Services, where you are located in the world and if one of
            the following applies: (i) you have given your consent for one or
            more specific purposes; this, however, does not apply, whenever the
            processing of Personal Information is subject to California Consumer
            Privacy Act; (ii) provision of information is necessary for the
            performance of an agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual
            obligations thereof; (iii) processing is necessary for compliance
            with a legal obligation to which you are subject; (iv) processing is
            related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in
            the exercise of official authority vested in us; (v) processing is
            necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us
            or by a third party.
          </p>
          <p>
            {' '}
            Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process
            information until you object to such processing by opting out,
            without having to rely on consent or any other of the legal bases.
            In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis
            that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the
            provision of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual
            requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.
          </p>
          <h2>Payment processing</h2>
          <p>
            In case of Services requiring payment, you may need to provide your
            credit card details or other payment account information, which will
            be used solely for processing payments. We use third-party payment
            processors (“Payment Processors”) to assist us in processing your
            payment information securely.
          </p>
          <p>
            Payment Processors adhere to the latest security standards as
            managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint
            effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and
            Discover. Sensitive and private data exchange happens over a SSL
            secured communication channel and is encrypted and protected with
            digital signatures, and the Services are also in compliance with
            strict vulnerability standards in order to create as secure of an
            environment as possible for Users. We will share payment data with
            the Payment Processors only to the extent necessary for the purposes
            of processing your payments, refunding such payments, and dealing
            with complaints and queries related to such payments and refunds.
          </p>
          <p>
            {' '}
            Please note that the Payment Processors may collect some Personal
            Information from you, which allows them to process your payments
            (e.g., your email address, address, credit card details, and bank
            account number) and handle all the steps in the payment process
            through their systems, including data collection and data
            processing. The Payment Processors’ use of your Personal Information
            is governed by their respective privacy policies which may or may
            not contain privacy protections as protective as this Policy. We
            suggest that you review their respective privacy policies.
          </p>
          <h2>Managing information</h2>
          <p>
            You are able to delete certain Personal Information we have about
            you. The Personal Information you can delete may change as the
            Services change. When you delete Personal Information, however, we
            may maintain a copy of the unrevised Personal Information in our
            records for the duration necessary to comply with our obligations to
            our affiliates and partners, and for the purposes described below.
            If you would like to delete your Personal Information or permanently
            delete your account, you can do so on the settings page of your
            account on the Services or simply by contacting us.
          </p>
          <h2>Disclosure of information</h2>
          <p>
            {' '}
            Depending on the requested Services or as necessary to complete any
            transaction or provide any Service you have requested, we may share
            your information with our trusted subsidiaries and joint venture
            partners, affiliates, contracted companies, and service providers
            (collectively, “Service Providers”) we rely upon to assist in the
            operation of the Services available to you and whose privacy
            policies are consistent with ours or who agree to abide by our
            policies with respect to Personal Information. We will not share any
            personally identifiable information with third parties and will not
            share any information with unaffiliated third parties.
          </p>
          <p>
            Service Providers are not authorized to use or disclose your
            information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or
            comply with legal requirements. Service Providers are given the
            information they need only in order to perform their designated
            functions, and we do not authorize them to use or disclose any of
            the provided information for their own marketing or other purposes.
            We will share and disclose your information only with the following
            categories of Service Providers:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Cloud computing services</li>
            <li>Communication and collaboration services</li>
            <li>Data analytics services</li>
            <li>Data storage services</li>
            <li>Payment processors</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We may also disclose any Personal Information we collect, use or
            receive if required or permitted by law, such as to comply with a
            subpoena or similar legal process, and when we believe in good faith
            that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your
            safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a
            government request.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the event we go through a business transition, such as a merger
            or acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of
            its assets, your user account, and your Personal Information will
            likely be among the assets transferred.
          </p>
          <h2>Retention of information</h2>
          <p>
            We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period
            necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to enforce our
            agreements, resolve disputes, and unless a longer retention period
            is required or permitted by law.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your
            Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a
            manner that would identify you personally. Once the retention period
            expires, Personal Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right
            to access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification, and the
            right to data portability cannot be enforced after the expiration of
            the retention period.
          </p>
          <h2>California privacy rights</h2>
          <p>
            Consumers residing in California are afforded certain additional
            rights with respect to their Personal Information under the
            California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”). If you are a California
            resident, this section applies to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to the rights as explained in this Policy, California
            residents who provide Personal Information as defined in the statute
            to obtain Services for personal, family, or household use are
            entitled to request and obtain from us, once a calendar year,
            information about the categories and specific pieces of Personal
            Information we have collected and disclosed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, California residents have the right to request deletion
            of their Personal Information or opt-out of the sale of their
            Personal Information which may include selling, disclosing, or
            transferring Personal Information to another business or a third
            party for monetary or other valuable consideration. To do so, simply
            contact us. We will not discriminate against you if you exercise
            your rights under the CCPA.
          </p>
          <h2>How to exercise your rights</h2>
          <p>
            Any requests to exercise your rights can be directed to us through
            the contact details provided in this document. Please note that we
            may ask you to verify your identity before responding to such
            requests. Your request must provide sufficient information that
            allows us to verify that you are the person you are claiming to be
            or that you are the authorized representative of such person. If we
            receive your request from an authorized representative, we may
            request evidence that you have provided such an authorized
            representative with power of attorney or that the authorized
            representative otherwise has valid written authority to submit
            requests on your behalf.
          </p>
          <p>
            You must include sufficient details to allow us to properly
            understand the request and respond to it. We cannot respond to your
            request or provide you with Personal Information unless we first
            verify your identity or authority to make such a request and confirm
            that the Personal Information relates to you.
          </p>
          <h2>Do Not Track signals</h2>
          <p>
            Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to
            websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity
            tracked. Tracking is not the same as using or collecting information
            in connection with a website. For these purposes, tracking refers to
            collecting personally identifiable information from consumers who
            use or visit a website or online service as they move across
            different websites over time. How browsers communicate the Do Not
            Track signal is not yet uniform. As a result, the Services are not
            yet set up to interpret or respond to Do Not Track signals
            communicated by your browser. Even so, as described in more detail
            throughout this Policy, we limit our use and collection of your
            Personal Information.
          </p>
          <h2>Email marketing</h2>
          <p>
            We offer electronic newsletters to which you may voluntarily
            subscribe at any time. We are committed to keeping your e-mail
            address confidential and will not disclose your email address to any
            third parties except as allowed in the information use and
            processing section or for the purposes of utilizing a third-party
            provider to send such emails. We will maintain the information sent
            via e-mail in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
          </p>
          <p>
            In compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act, all e-mails sent from us will
            clearly state who the e-mail is from and provide clear information
            on how to contact the sender. You may choose to stop receiving our
            newsletter or marketing emails by following the unsubscribe
            instructions included in these emails or by contacting us. However,
            you will continue to receive essential transactional emails.
          </p>
          <h2>Links to other resources</h2>
          <p>
            The Services contain links to other resources that are not owned or
            controlled by us. Please be aware that we are not responsible for
            the privacy practices of such other resources or third parties. We
            encourage you to be aware when you leave the Services and to read
            the privacy statements of each and every resource that may collect
            Personal Information.
          </p>
          <h2>Information security</h2>
          <p>
            We secure information you provide on computer servers in a
            controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access,
            use, or disclosure. We maintain reasonable administrative,
            technical, and physical safeguards in an effort to protect against
            unauthorized access, use, modification, and disclosure of Personal
            Information in our control and custody. However, no data
            transmission over the Internet or wireless network can be
            guaranteed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, you
            acknowledge that (i) there are security and privacy limitations of
            the Internet which are beyond our control; (ii) the security,
            integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged
            between you and the Services cannot be guaranteed; and (iii) any
            such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit
            by a third party, despite best efforts.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the security of Personal Information depends in part on the
            security of the device you use to communicate with us and the
            security you use to protect your credentials, please take
            appropriate measures to protect this information.
          </p>
          <h2>Data breach</h2>
          <p>
            In the event we become aware that the security of the Services has
            been compromised or Users’ Personal Information has been disclosed
            to unrelated third parties as a result of external activity,
            including, but not limited to, security attacks or fraud, we reserve
            the right to take reasonably appropriate measures, including, but
            not limited to, investigation and reporting, as well as notification
            to and cooperation with law enforcement authorities. In the event of
            a data breach, we will make reasonable efforts to notify affected
            individuals if we believe that there is a reasonable risk of harm to
            the User as a result of the breach or if notice is otherwise
            required by law. When we do, we will post a notice on the Services,
            send you an email.
          </p>
          <h2>Changes and amendments</h2>
          <p>
            We reserve the right to modify this Policy or its terms related to
            the Services at any time at our discretion. When we do, we will send
            you an email to notify you. We may also provide notice to you in
            other ways at our discretion, such as through the contact
            information you have provided.
          </p>
          <p>
            An updated version of this Policy will be effective immediately upon
            the posting of the revised Policy unless otherwise specified. Your
            continued use of the Services after the effective date of the
            revised Policy (or such other act specified at that time) will
            constitute your consent to those changes. However, we will not,
            without your consent, use your Personal Information in a manner
            materially different than what was stated at the time your Personal
            Information was collected.
          </p>
